PANDASEQ-SAM
============

PANDASEQ-SAM is a program to align Illumina reads, optionally with PCR primers embedded in the sequence, and reconstruct an overlapping sequence. This version works on SAM/BAM formatted files.

INSTALLATION
------------

A working version of PANDAseq must first be installed, including the development headers. If using the Ubuntu packages, install the pandaseq-dev package.

First, download the samtools source:
	git submodule init && git submodule update

You should now have a `samtools' subdirectory populated with files including `sam.h' and `khash.h'. If this doesn't occur, or you are working from non-git sources, you can download this separately and place it in that directory.

After the samtools sources are present, one should be able to do:
	./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && sudo make install

If you receive an error that libpandaseq-sam.so.0 is not found, try running:
	sudo ldconfig

USAGE
-----

Please consult the manual page by invoking
	man pandaseq-sam
though this is only summarises the differences. Consult
	man pandaseq
for the details.

The short version is
	pandaseq-sam -f seq.sam
or
	pandaseq-sam -b -f seq.bam
